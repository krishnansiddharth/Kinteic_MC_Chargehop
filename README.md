# MC_ChargeHop
A code for running Monte Carlo simulation of charge hopping on a graph based network
You can edit the simualtion time for each run and the number of runs for the MC simualtion in graphMC.py code. 
Run the graphMC.py code to generate the trajectory of the charge in each run and store it into trajectory.dat
