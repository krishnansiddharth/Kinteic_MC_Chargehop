The repository simualtes single electron charge hopping over a graph based network representation of the CTPR protein.
The edges(hopping rates) are provided in the generated_rates*.dat files. 
To run the MC code run the graphMC.py with the number of CTPR units as input
To analyze the trajectory and obtain average times, run analysis.py with the number of CTPR units as input..
The plot.py plots all the currents for the CTPR proteins of different lenghts.
